# SQL Homework

For this lab, we will use sqlite3, it is already available on your machine using the command `sqlite3`, copy the file sql_dump.sql in a folder where your sqlite3 database will be, then type:

```
sqlite3 wishlists.db < sql_dump.sql
```
This will create the database wishlists. Unlike Postgres, sqlite3 create a file in the folder where you are, if you delete this file, you delete the db !

To connect to the database, type `sqlite3 wishlists.db`, then you can execute sql statements.

Write SQL statements that:

    1. Selects the names of all products that are not on sale.
    2. Selects the names of all products that cost less than £20.
    3. Selects the name and price of the most expensive product.
    4. Selects the name and price of the second most expensive product.
    5. Selects the name and price of the least expensive product.
    6. Selects the names and prices of all products, ordered by price in descending order.
    7. Selects the average price of all products.
    8. Selects the sum of the price of all products.
    9. Selects the sum of the price of all products whose prices is less than £20.
    10. Selects the id of the user with your name.
    11. Selects the names of all users whose names start with the letter "J".
    12. Selects the number of users whose first names are "Spencer".
    13. Selects the number of users who want a "Teddy Bear".

    15. Selects the count and name of all products on the wishlist, ordered by count in descending order.
    16. Selects the count and name of all products that are not on sale on the wishlist, ordered by count in descending order.
    17. Inserts a user with the name "Jonathan Anderson" into the users table. Ensure the created_at column is set to the current time.
